BlackBerry Pull to Refresh
============================

Okay, so I've seen one example of pull to refresh implemented on the BB10 platform, however it didn't quite work as I wanted. Also, I can't seem to find where it was that I found it.

Anywho! I forked the [BlackBerry 10 Cascades Samples] (https://github.com/mrnickel/Cascades-Samples). Specifically I'm using the [Twitter Timeline] (https://github.com/mrnickel/Cascades-Samples/tree/master/twittertimeline) example.

So give this a fork and play around. I'll be adding more code as I find time. I'll also do a quick write-up as to exactly what's happening on [my website] (http://www.ryannickel.com)
